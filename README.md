# The Matrix Resurrections: Terminal Movie Experience

Welcome, Operator. You've accessed a unique system diagnostic: a terminal-based "movie" that reimagines *The Matrix Resurrections* from the perspective of the Matrix system itself. Witness the unfolding events as a series of logs, process traces, AI debug messages, and cryptic system commentary, all within your terminal.

This project is a nerdy, immersive experience for tech enthusiasts and Matrix fans, designed to simulate a system administrator watching the digital world react to Neo and Trinity's return.

## Features

*   **Purely Terminal-Based**: No GUIs, just pure text-mode output in a Linux-style terminal.
*   **Automated Playback**: A non-interactive, timed "movie" that runs for approximately 10-12 minutes.
*   **Matrix Code Rain**: Iconic green code rain animations at the start and as transitions between scenes.
*   **System Log Aesthetic**: Output styled to mimic `dmesg`, `journalctl`, `strace`, `tcpdump`, and other familiar Linux tools, but with a Matrix twist.
*   **Humorous & Cryptic AI Commentary**: Get insights from the Analyst AI and other system processes through their debug logs and internal messages.
*   **Follows Matrix 4 Plot**: Key plot points of *The Matrix Resurrections* are represented from the machine's viewpoint across 8 distinct scenes.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed (preferably Python 3.7+).
*   **Rich Library**: The project uses the `rich` Python library for terminal formatting and animations.
*   A terminal that supports ANSI escape codes and UTF-8 (most modern terminals do).

## Installation & Running the Movie

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    ```
    Navigate into the cloned repository directory (e.g., `cd name_of_cloned_repository`).

2.  **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Movie**:
    *   **Using the shell script (recommended for Linux/macOS)**:
        Make sure your terminal window is maximized for the best experience!
        ```bash
        sh run.sh
        ```
        If you get a permission error, you might need to make it executable first: `chmod +x run.sh` (though the subtask should have handled this).

    *   **Directly with Python**:
        Make sure your terminal window is maximized!
        ```bash
        python3 matrix_resurrections_terminal_movie.py
        ```
        (Or `python matrix_resurrections_terminal_movie.py` if `python3` is not your command for Python 3).

5.  **Enjoy the Show!**
    Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit the movie.

## Project Structure

All scripts and primary directories are now located at the root of the repository:

*   `matrix_resurrections_terminal_movie.py`: The main Python driver script for the movie.
*   `run.sh`: A shell script for easy launching on Linux/macOS.
*   `README.md`: This file.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
*   `scenes/`: Directory containing individual Python scripts for each movie scene.
*   `utils/`: Directory containing helper utilities, primarily `renderer.py` for terminal effects.
*   `ascii_art/`: Directory originally planned for ASCII art; currently holds a `.gitkeep` file as thematic art was removed to enhance the raw terminal feel.
*   `venv/`: (If created by user following instructions) Directory for the Python virtual environment (typically added to `.gitignore`).

## A Note on Style

This project intentionally avoids complex ASCII art for logos or faces within the movie itself (post initial feedback) to maintain the authentic feel of observing a live terminal feed. The focus is on the text, the timing, and the simulated system environment.
